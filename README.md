## Description

This Node.js application uses many different back-end/npm packages to create a CMS-style tech blog site! This application is meant to showcase my full-stack developer skills. This application uses a MySQL database and Express.js server for the back end. The front-end is built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and a template engine name Handlebars.js. The application also shows how authentication can be incorporated into a website.
